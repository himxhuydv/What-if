# Hello... fellows To My messy Repo Of What If? 

**So, every time I expand my knowledge and start devouring it, I always get into the gigantic mess of questions. You can also say dense, like an Amazon forest kind of that, also termed as what if questions.**

```That why I have created this Repo "What If?".```

**Everything starts with a question in mind. I was, from my childhood, a confused guy. I was always wondering around how everything works. I always had this curiosity that created this monster "What If?" This happened, so I always try to find the answer.**
*I always wonder*
**What if this happened, what will I do or they do or** *more importantly what if this happened what then will the machine do* **that how this repo is created. I have created this repo only to write all What If? questions.**
*So,now explore my what if repo*
